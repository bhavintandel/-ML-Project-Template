### Template for Machine Learning Project

With increase in ML projects, every enthusiast want to develop best model. And in achieve that one loose track of the project and the code base. This often leads to spending more time on refactoring the project structure and delivering the final product. Many companies are now trying to follow a structure for ML project so that, project can be more productive and easy to explore. 

This template allow one to get start on the project in an organized way. Many website were consulted to make this template, Most of the ideas were picked from Microsoft's [Team Data Science Process](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/team-data-science-process/overview) which was developed by best mind in the world.
